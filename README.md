## Usage notes
- To use the App after downloading it, right-click on the app's icon, and then press "Open." Clicking only once on the icon will most likely fail to open the app on the first trial due to it being an app downloaded from the internet. By doing right-click > Open, Apple treats it as a different instruction. Afterwards it should work by just clicking the icon once as any other app.
- When using the App for the first time, please read "About" file, which is accessible by clicking on the "Help" button on the App, and it contains all the relevant information about the App.
